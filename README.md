## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

For our project, we hope to carry out a view on which types of people, based on different attributes, will be more likely to choose a banking term deposit. This project would be an interesting one because in the approaching post-pandemic world, the globe is expecting a financial recession, so for us it could be important to look for different financing options, whether to secure financial stabilities or “blockbusting” opportunities. With that in mind, and add up that term deposits are usually considered as a safer financing option, our question would be to know which type of people would most likely be on term deposit, so that we as individuals will hopefully learn something from it and make our decision wisely.

We will compile our project based on different key attributes, namely : occupations, account balance, marital status and education level. The user-facing Dashboard will summarise and compare between results and hopefully, our question will be answered.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The data is collected from between 30th April 2008 to 31st November 2010, which was used as part of a telephonic marketing campaign for a banking institution in Portugal. The data is collected into a server log by humans during the telephone conversation by the marketing campaign. It is filled with entities of contacting clients, though users need to be aware that, for often, there could be more than one contact of the same client as the marketing campaign needs to access if the customer would be subscribed to the bank term deposit or not.

There are 18 attributes in this dataset, each records a client information from the bank such as: age, job, marital status, education level, balance, housing loan, term deposit subscription status, etc. The purpose for this dataset is to identify and predict if a potential customer would opt for term deposit or not, and hints the financial and personal information in the dataset.
